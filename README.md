# AvoPets

This project is made for the Stevenson 24 hour Hackathon on 3/4 - 3/5.

The official name is AvoPets (short for Avocado Pets), and our mission statement is to help and teach kids how to stay healthy starting at a young age. It works by incentivizing children to level up their pet and get cooler outfits (may not be implemented yet) through rewards they earn from working out and practicing mindfulness.

It is written in flet which is a combination of Flutter and Python.

This app is not fully built, and many features can be added.
For example, we wanted to connect to either FitBit or Apple Watch APIs to make the tracking for everything much easier.

We used Firebase and Firestore for login credentials + extra variables that change based on account.
