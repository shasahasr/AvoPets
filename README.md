# AvoPets

This project is made for the Stevenson 24 hour Hackathon on 3/4 - 3/5.

It is written in flet which is a combination of Flutter and Python.

This app is not fully built, and many features can be added.
For example, we wanted to connect to either FitBit or Apple Watch APIs to make the tracking for everything much easier.

We used Firebase and Firestore for login credentials + extra variables that change based on account.
